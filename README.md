# 🏎️Formula 1 Analytics Engineering Project

This repository documents my journey from data analysis into analytics engineering, using Formula 1 data as a practical foundation.

The goal of this project is not just to build dashboards, but to explore how raw data can be transformed into analytics-ready models that are easy to understand, reliable, and scalable.

Everything here is learning-driven and problem-led.

## Why Formula 1?

Formula 1 data is:
- Relational and messy in its raw form
- Rich enough to model real-world analytics problems
- Familiar, which helps focus on data design rather than domain confusion

It’s a great sandbox for practising data modelling, SQL structuring, and analytics engineering concepts.

## What this project covers

Across this repository, I explore:

- Working with raw, unmodelled datasets
- Designing fact and dimension tables
- Defining grain and business logic clearly
- Writing clean, maintainable SQL
- Introducing dbt fundamentals for transformation and testing
- Building thin, performant dashboards on top of trusted models

Each step is tied to a specific problem and trade-off.

## Tools used

- SQL
- BigQuery and Snowflake (where relevant)
- dbt (fundamentals)
- Tableau
- GitHub Pages for documentation

---

## How to navigate this repo

- `/docs`  
  Long-form write-ups and reflections, published via GitHub Pages

- `/sql`  
  SQL used for modelling and transformations

- `/diagrams`  
  Data model diagrams and sketches

- `/dashboards`  
  Visual outputs and supporting material

Not everything is polished. That’s intentional.

## How this is shared

Key learnings from this project are also shared in shorter form on LinkedIn, with GitHub Pages acting as the long-form home for deeper explanation.

---

## Status

This is an active, evolving project.

I’m building this incrementally, learning by doing, and documenting decisions as I go.
