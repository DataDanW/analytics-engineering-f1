# Analytics Engineering with Formula 1

This site documents my journey into analytics engineering, using Formula 1 data as a practical, real-world foundation.

Rather than focusing on theory alone, each post here is driven by a specific problem and a decision that needed to be made. The aim is to show how raw data can be transformed into analytics-ready models that are easier to understand, easier to maintain, and easier to build insights from.

This is a learning project, but it’s also a portfolio.

## 🎨 What this project is about

Modern analytics roles are shifting.

It’s no longer just about building dashboards. It’s about:
- Designing trustworthy data models
- Writing clean, maintainable SQL
- Moving business logic upstream
- Enabling faster, simpler analysis downstream

This project explores those ideas step by step.

## 🏎️ Why Formula 1?

Formula 1 data works well for this kind of learning because it is:
- Highly relational
- Messy in its raw form
- Rich enough to model realistic analytics scenarios
- It's fun - I completed a 24-part Formula 1 data visualisation challenge in Tableau. So why not continue..

Using a familiar domain keeps the focus on data design and engineering decisions rather than domain knowledge.

## 📃How this site is structured

Each post follows a simple pattern:

1. A problem to solve  
2. The approach taken  
3. The trade-offs involved  
4. What I learned  

Posts build on each other, starting from raw, unmodelled data and gradually introducing better structure, tooling, and practices.

## ⚙️Tools and concepts explored

Across the project, I’ll touch on:

- SQL and data modelling
- Fact and dimension tables
- BigQuery and Snowflake
- dbt fundamentals
- Tableau and analytics-ready data design

Not every tool appears in every post. Each one is introduced only when it solves a real problem.

## 📍Where to start

If you’re new here, start at the beginning:

- **Part 1:** Working with raw Formula 1 data and why big tables cause problems  
- **Part 2:** Introducing data modelling and defining grain  
- **Part 3:** Structuring transformations with dbt  

(Links will appear here as posts are published.)

## 🔊 Sharing and updates

Shorter reflections and summaries from this project are also shared on LinkedIn, with this site acting as the long-form home for deeper explanation and context.

## Status

This project is ongoing.

I’m building it incrementally, learning by doing, and documenting decisions along the way.
